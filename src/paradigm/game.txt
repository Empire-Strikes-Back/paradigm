i am paradigm game program, i say this is the world of Paradigm Triplanetary System:

4 factions
  plex (red and black, complicated steel like structures, control)
  vitaal (lazure blue, white,energy - highly eveolved)
  abstract (shadowy)
  tribes (multicolor, patchy, small ships)

abstract

  were before plex
  academic, learners
  want to learn to detroy spacetime
  willingly use plex as workforce

vitaal

  the only who can use datum particles 
  abstract want to obtain that knowledge
  build most advacned ships, use enegry and datum particles
  learned there is a a planet with inofromation on how to do intergalactic travels
  so did plex and tribes - both searching for it; abstract think it's insignificant in comparison to disovling spacetime

tribes

  mostly live on the outer rim
  build light small ships, from parts and pieces, multicolor, patchy style
  move in fleets
  always opressed by plex to work for them
  don't like vitaal, plex or abstract

plex

  complex, bureaucratic, control
  build most coplicated enormous structures, heavy, colors of red and steel
  so complex, they can only be maintained by countless workforce
  hate vitaal and are respectful to abstract, despise tribes
  want to take over everything

gameplay

i give players a map of space - planets and fleets (very very light and air-y and colorful and disctict, but with a scent of of Imperium Galactica 2 and Heroes of Might and Magic 3)
players porgram their fleets and use planets, then battle and conquest victory
when players program, they say "over the next 10 cycles, this fleet moves like this, and if that and that, does else instead"
players look at the map, what planet and fleet positions are and program their behavior for next time i run the simulation cycle, then see fleets combat, resources collected
